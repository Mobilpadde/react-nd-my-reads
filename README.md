# My Reads

*A magical fairy-tale kingdom for your books*.

## Getting Started

Simply use `npm i` to install the dependencies, and `npm start` to start the server.

When you start he app, you'll see a simple page. On this magnificent page, you can see three, what they call, shelves, each with a couple of books within. If you don't like the position of a book, you can move it around, by using the green arrow-down in the bottom right corner of the book.

## Searching

Like most every person, whom ever read a book, they'll read another book, and would like to look for other books, to allow into the Kingdom of Books. This is where the Peasant=land of Books come in, or  **Search**-page as it's known as in the common tounge.

To get to this bea-u-tiful page, press either the `spacebar`, the `enter`-key or the plus-sign in the bottom right corner.

## Getting Back

Well, so long so good. But how do you come back to the Kingdom of Books? For this, I've cooked up a simple shortcut, which is, as you've already guessed, `ESC`.

So long, and thanks for all the fish.
